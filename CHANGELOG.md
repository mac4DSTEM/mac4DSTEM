# Changelog

## v1.0.0 — 2026-08-06

Native macOS 4D-STEM analysis for Apple Silicon, validated against
[py4DSTEM](https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM) 0.14.19.

First tagged release.

### The workflow

A frozen five-stage product workflow — **Prepare → Image / Map / Reconstruct →
Results** — with task-scoped controls and per-task readiness. Every result
carries its model, scale, units and validity through display, export and
reopen.

### Analysis

- **Calibration** — origin/probe fitting, detector-ellipse correction, R–Q
  rotation, Q and R pixel scales, each with explicit provenance and a stated
  consequence when missing. No missing value is ever synthesized.
- **Virtual imaging** — BF/ADF/HAADF and custom annular, rectangular and point
  detectors, dragged live on the diffraction pane.
- **DPC / iDPC** — beam-deflection mapping and integrated projected phase,
  measured against fitted per-position origins.
- **Bragg disk detection** — GPU cross-correlation with parabolic, pixel and
  Fourier (multicorr) subpixel refinement.
- **Strain mapping** — reference region or whole-scan mean, automatic or manual
  g₁/g₂ basis, with basis consensus, fit residual, indexed fraction and
  reference-inlier diagnostics published alongside every map.
- **ACOM orientation** — template matching against a built-in crystal library
  or an imported CIF, with symmetry expansion, IPF·Z colouring and a
  reliability read-out.
- **Parallax / ptychography** — coarse-to-fine bright-field alignment,
  aberration fitting, phase correction, depth sectioning, and single-slice
  iterative object/probe recovery.

### Data

- HDF5/EMD, DM4/DM3, MIB, RAW and vendor XML readers.
- EMD export of Bragg vectors, calibrated datacubes and preprocessed products,
  published atomically via a same-volume scratch directory so a sandboxed save
  cannot leave a partial file.
- Publication figures burn in scale bar, colorbar and caption — including the
  display orientation when one is applied, because an applied-but-unrecorded
  rotation is not acceptable.

### Verification

`tools/run-tests.sh all` — **exit 0, 30 harnesses**: 105 unit tests, 28
scientific parity harnesses, real-data acceptance, and packaging. Parity is
measured against py4DSTEM 0.14.19 on a four-dataset training set, with records
in `References/parity_records/`.

A separate on-screen QC playthrough (`tools/ui-qc-playthrough/run.sh`) drives
the real app through the canonical py4DSTEM pipelines and logs every number it
reads from the app's own controls. Its last full run was green on all four
datasets.

**What this release was *not* verified by, stated plainly:** no visual QC
baseline exists. Every playthrough run to date used `--no-screenshots`, so the
acceptance evidence for v1.0.0 is numeric only — the numbers the app reports
through its own controls, not what it draws. Creating that baseline needs
Screen Recording granted to the ad-hoc-signed test runner; it was deliberately
deferred rather than faked, and it is the first entry in
[`docs/open-items.md`](docs/open-items.md).

### Fixed at the close of the phase (2026-08-06)

- **Q calibration could be stamped "Measured in app" from an origin the app had
  already flagged as unusable.** On one training dataset that produced a Q pixel
  size 2.56× too large, and the label — not the warning — is what travelled into
  export, reopen and the QC log. `calibrateQFromCrystal` now refuses on the same
  predicate the Prepare readiness row uses, so the badge, the app's behaviour
  and the parity records cannot disagree. The underlying estimator is *not*
  fixed and is fragile to origin error well below that threshold — recorded in
  [`docs/post-v1-ideas.md`](docs/post-v1-ideas.md) as a deliberate scope
  decision, not an oversight.
- **The Result colormap was unreachable from the Results workspace**, the one
  screen built for looking at results.
- **The readiness row called a measured origin "Missing"** directly above a
  detail line reporting it as measured. It now reads "Not quantitative".
- **Split-view height regression (#16/#22)** — a single `fixedSize` propagated a
  minimum height past the window's own, making the sidebar's top rows inert.

### Distribution

Hardened runtime, sandboxed, self-contained, no Homebrew dylib dependency,
macOS 14 floor — **declared, never tested below macOS 26** (corrected 2026-08-28; the clean-account launch was on macOS 27 only). The supported floor is now macOS 26, stated in `README.md`. Developer ID signing, notarization and a clean-account launch
remain release-owner actions.

### Deliberately out of scope

Cropping and partial/binned loading, multi-slice ptychography, and a WS₂ crystal
model. See [`docs/post-v1-ideas.md`](docs/post-v1-ideas.md).

## Working notes

The v1.0 development phase's item-level record — 46 numbered findings, the
design passes, and the QC-evaluation prompts — is archived under
[`docs/archive/v1.0/`](docs/archive/v1.0/). It is history, not guidance; nothing
in the current docs points into it. `docs/open-items.md` carries forward only
what is still live.
