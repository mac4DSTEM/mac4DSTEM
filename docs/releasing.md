# Releasing mac4DSTEM

The repository can build and audit an unsigned/ad-hoc Release without private
credentials. Public distribution additionally requires the release owner’s Apple
Developer Program membership, a **Developer ID Application** certificate, and
notary-service credentials. Those secrets do not belong in the repository.

## Release contract

- Bundle identifier: `com.mac4dstem.mac4DSTEM`
- Version/build: `2.0` / `2` (v2.0.0 tag, 2026-09-02)
- Minimum system: macOS 14
- Hardened runtime and App Sandbox enabled
- User-selected read/write access plus app-scoped security bookmarks
- HDF5, sz, and aec libraries embedded, nested-signed, and free of Homebrew paths

## Before using credentials

Run the complete gate from the repository root:

```sh
tools/run-tests.sh all
```

This includes XCTest, scientific/source-locked harnesses, the checked-in real-data
goldens and time budget, and an ad-hoc hardened Release package audit.

## Developer ID archive

Install the certificate in the login keychain, then use its full name:

```sh
export DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION='Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)'
tools/release/build-developer-id.sh
```

The command archives with a secure timestamp, validates nested signatures and
entitlements, and writes `build/release/mac4DSTEM.xcarchive`. Do not distribute the
pre-notarization ZIP.

## Notarize and staple

Store credentials once with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`, then:

```sh
export NOTARY_PROFILE=mac4dstem-notary
tools/release/notarize.sh \
  build/release/mac4DSTEM.xcarchive/Products/Applications/mac4DSTEM.app
```

The script submits with `notarytool --wait`, staples and validates the ticket,
runs Gatekeeper assessment, and produces `mac4DSTEM-1.0.zip`. Preserve the archive,
notary submission ID/log, commit hash, and final SHA-256 together as release
provenance. Test the ZIP on a clean **macOS 26+** account before publishing —
the floor was raised from 14 on 2026-08-28, because the app had never been run
below macOS 26 and the declared floor said otherwise.

## The disk image users actually download

`tools/release/make-dmg.sh` was missing from this document until 2026-08-28,
which meant the one artefact users actually download had no written procedure.

```sh
tools/release/make-dmg.sh \
  build/release/mac4DSTEM.xcarchive/Products/Applications/mac4DSTEM.app
```

**Order matters, and getting it wrong produces a download that fails on first
launch with no network.** Take a *stapled* app, build the DMG from it, then run
`notarize.sh` **again on the DMG**: the image is signed by `make-dmg.sh` but not
notarized there. Stapling the app alone is not enough — Gatekeeper assesses the
thing the user actually opened, which is the image.

The window layout is written straight into the image's `.DS_Store` by
`dmgbuild`, deliberately not by driving the Finder with AppleScript: the
AppleScript recipe is the common one and it does not survive automation, since
it needs an Automation grant and a live Finder.

Apple’s required process is Developer ID signing with hardened runtime, a secure
timestamp, notarization, and ticket stapling; `altool` is no longer supported.

## Distribution and notarization

*(merged from `distribution.md`, 2026-09-02)*

The project now produces a self-contained, hardened, sandboxed macOS app. The
target embeds `libhdf5.dylib`, `libsz.2.dylib`, and `libaec.0.dylib` in
`Contents/Frameworks`; Xcode signs each nested library with the app identity.

Run the credential-free release audit before archiving:

```sh
tools/package-test/run.sh
```

This clean-builds an ad-hoc Release app, verifies the nested code signatures,
relative HDF5 dependency closure, sandbox/read-write/bookmark entitlements and
absence of `get-task-allow`, then opens a checked-in HDF5 fixture using only the
library inside the app bundle. It does not claim Developer ID signing or Apple
notarization.

## Credentialed release

The release owner must supply:

- an Apple Developer Program team and stable production bundle identifier;
- a **Developer ID Application** certificate in the signing keychain;
- a `notarytool` keychain profile (or equivalent App Store Connect API key);
- final version/build numbers and a ZIP, DMG, or PKG distribution container.

Preferred workflow: Archive in Xcode, open Organizer, choose **Distribute App →
Developer ID → Upload**, review the notary log, then export the stapled result.
For automation, export a Developer ID-signed archive, create a notarization ZIP
with `ditto -c -k --keepParent`, submit it with
`xcrun notarytool submit --keychain-profile PROFILE --wait`, and staple the
accepted ticket to the app or DMG with `xcrun stapler staple`.

Apple requires Developer ID signing, Hardened Runtime, a secure timestamp, and
no `get-task-allow` entitlement for notarization. See Apple’s
[notarization requirements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing-macos-software-before-distribution)
and [custom workflow](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/customizing-the-notarization-workflow).

## Sandboxed file access

Dataset and export URLs come from system Open/Save panels. A session sidecar’s
first save also uses a Save panel, defaulted beside the source dataset, and the
app stores an app-scoped security bookmark for later atomic updates and reopen.
This explicit grant is necessary because selecting a source file does not grant
blanket access to every sibling in its directory.
