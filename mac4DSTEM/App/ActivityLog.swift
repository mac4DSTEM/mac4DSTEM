//
//  ActivityLog.swift
//  Role: The session's rolling record of what happened, shown in the output
//        strip along the bottom of the science panes.
//
//  An `AppState` seam (docs/archive/development-process-2026-08-31.md §7),
//  under CLAUDE.md's rule that a session touching `AppState` moves one
//  responsibility out of it. It sits in App/ rather than Session/ for the
//  same reason `WorkspaceNavigation` does: it is view-state with no science
//  in it, and Session/ is a package the app target excludes file by file.
//
//  Views read `activityLog.messages`; no forwarding properties on `AppState`.
//
//  `@Observable` here is load-bearing, not ceremony: `WorkspaceView`'s output
//  strip reads `lines` and scrolls on the newest line's id, and without observation
//  the strip goes silently stale. `ActivityLogTests` pins the whole chain
//  with `withObservationTracking` rather than trusting the annotation.
