/// Zoom and pan for a scientific image pane — pure SwiftUI.
///
/// UI deliberately drops the AppKit scroll-wheel monitor the old panes
/// installed (`NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents`, application-wide, which
/// swallowed scrolls for the whole app whenever a pane's hover never
/// reported `.ended`). What is left:
/// - `MagnifyGesture`: a trackpad pinch. It zooms ABOUT THE POINTER, the point the pinch began at, so the pixel you are looking
///   at stays under it.
/// - View > Zoom In, Zoom Out, Zoom to Fit (`ZoomCommands`), with the shortcuts, for the keyboard and a mouse: about the pointer
///   when it is over the pane, else about the pane's centre.
/// - VoiceOver's zoom and pan actions, and a double-click, which fits the image to the pane again.
///
/// **A mouse wheel does not zoom.** An earlier version of this comment said macOS synthesises magnification from the wheel with
/// a modifier. Nothing documents that: Apple describes `MagnifyGesture` as tracking a magnification event sequence, and a search of
/// the SwiftUI documentation (2026-10-14) finds no scroll-wheel hook either. The claim is withdrawn rather than relied on, and
/// the menu is the mouse's route. Only the old monitor bought a wheel route, at the cost of the global event trap above. (The
/// same sentence is in `SpectrumStripView`'s header comment.)
///
/// The clamp is the science-relevant part. The views scale the image about
/// its centre (`scaleEffect(drawZoom)`) and then offset it in screen points
/// (`offset(effectiveOffset)`), so the scaled image is `size * zoom` wide and
/// one edge reaches the pane's edge exactly when `|offset| = size * (zoom - 1) / 2`
/// per axis. The clamp stops there, so panning can never push the image out
/// of its own pane.
