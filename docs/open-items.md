# Open items

Everything still live after **v1.0.0** (tagged 2026-08-06).

> **Active feature work is planned separately** in
> [`docs/load-pipeline-plan.md`](load-pipeline-plan.md) — load progress, a
> resident in-memory cube, crop/bin on open. It is kept out of this file on
> purpose: every item here is UI/workflow-only and touches no `Core/`, which is
> what makes this list safe to hand out as implementation prompts. Two items
> below are claimed by that plan and are noted where they appear (**#36** —

Closed items are not here — the full v1.0 record is
[`docs/archive/v1.0/ui-workflow-backlog.md`](archive/v1.0/ui-workflow-backlog.md),
kept as history. Cited numbers are prefixed `#` and refer to that file.

## Phase 2 was planned — 2026-08-17

**No decisions are owed.** The contract is [`docs/v2-scope.md`](v2-scope.md):
priority order, refusal rule, version policy, and the eight decisions with their
reasons. `docs/v2-planning-draft.md` is deleted; every proposal in it was
accepted, changed, or rejected.

Settled here and previously blocking: **a cropped/binned cube is a *view* of the
source file** (`load-pipeline-plan.md` §7.1). **L3 is unblocked.**

New work that came out of the session:

- **A free-space preflight in `tools/run-tests.sh`** — fail immediately with
  "need N GB free, have M" rather than letting a full disk produce three
  different failure sets that look like code regressions. ~15 lines; not yet
  written.
- **Delete or keep `mac4DSTEMUITests/` + `tools/ui-qc-playthrough/`?** Retired
  as the acceptance test and unmaintained, but still in the tree and still
  building. Deleting it also removes the only consumer of the accessibility
  identifiers that `docs/v1-scope.md` deliberately kept — check
  `mac4DSTEMUITests/Support/AXDriver.swift` before pulling the thread.

## Release-owner actions — **done 2026-08-14/15**

Developer ID signing, notarization and a clean-account launch all completed.
The repository is public at `github.com/mac4DSTEM/mac4DSTEM` under GPL-3.0, and
`v1.0.0` carries a signed, notarized, stapled `mac4DSTEM.dmg` linked from
mac4dstem.com.

The pipeline is now in the repo rather than in someone's shell history:
`tools/release/build-developer-id.sh` → `notarize.sh` (takes an `.app` *or* a
`.dmg`) → `make-dmg.sh` → `notarize.sh` again. Both the app and the image are
stapled, because Gatekeeper assesses the file the user actually opened.
`docs/releasing.md` predates `make-dmg.sh` and does not describe it yet.

Two things learned that are not obvious and cost time:

- **Stapling rewrites the DMG, so it changes the checksum.** `make-dmg.sh`
  prints a SHA-256 *before* the ticket is attached; publishing that one gives
  users a hash that does not match the download. Take the hash from the
  notarize step, or after.
- **The notary credential is not always readable from a non-interactive
  process.** `notarytool` failed with *No Keychain password item found* from an
  automated shell while working fine from Terminal; re-running
  `store-credentials` interactively fixed it permanently.

## Verification debt

- **No automated visual baseline, and there will not be one soon.** Every
  playthrough run used `--no-screenshots`, so the acceptance evidence for the
  tag is numeric only: the numbers the app reports through its own controls,
  never what it draws. **As of 2026-08-17 the answer is Track B, not a
  screenshot harness** — the XCUITest playthrough is retired and
  [`docs/visual-acceptance-checklist.md`](visual-acceptance-checklist.md) is the
  procedure. So any claim that a UI change "looks right" rests on someone having
  looked; say who, and when. It has earned that standing: two defects on tag day
  with all 30 harnesses green (the unreachable Result colormap, the readiness
  row calling a measured origin "Missing") and three more in the clean-account
  run.
- **`tools/bragg-spacing-probe/` gates nothing** and cannot: it needs a
  gitignored multi-gigabyte datacube. It stays a diagnostic.
- **The app has never run on the macOS version it claims to support.**
  `LSMinimumSystemVersion` is 14.0; every build, test run and manual session to
  date has been on macOS 27. Nothing between 14 and 26 has been exercised, and
  `SidebarLayoutTests` below is direct evidence that this app's layout does
  shift with the OS. Only a real older machine answers this.
- **`README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` claim `tools/run-tests.sh all` — exit 0, 30
  harnesses.** True at the tag, not reproducible now: the unit suite fails on
  macOS 27 (see `SidebarLayoutTests` below). The scientific harnesses and
  packaging are green; the aggregate gate is not. A verification claim that a
  reader cannot reproduce is the kind that costs credibility with exactly the
  people who check.

### First clean-account acceptance run — 2026-08-14

The v1.0 DMG was downloaded from mac4dstem.com in a fresh macOS account that had
never run the app, installed by drag, and driven through Prepare → Bragg disks →
Strain on `downsample_Si_SiGe_exp`. It worked: 248,384 peaks, 100% basis
consensus, 100% indexed, a quantitative ε_xx map with the expected SiGe layer
periodicity, and **no Gatekeeper warning at any point**.

That single run — perhaps fifteen minutes of human time — produced three defects
that no harness in the repo can reach. They are listed under *Known, scoped, not
blocking* below. This is the second time the Track B pattern in
Track B ([`docs/visual-acceptance-checklist.md`](visual-acceptance-checklist.md))
has outperformed the automated suite on its own terms.

## Known, scoped, not blocking

- **`SidebarLayoutTests.testEveryWorkspaceSidebarFitsItsColumn` fails on macOS
  27.** Uncalibrated Prepare measures 933pt against 871pt of column — 62pt of
  overflow against a 60pt allowance. **Not a regression:** `git diff v1.0.0..HEAD`
  over `mac4DSTEM/`, both test targets and `tools/` was empty when this first
  appeared, so no app code had changed. The test's own comment records the
  overflow as 49pt when written, giving 11pt of headroom; the OS moved 13pt.
  The question is not what broke but **whether 60 was ever a threshold or just
  one machine's measurement rounded up** — it will drift again on macOS 28.
- **The burned-in caption on exported figures truncates.** Observed on a strain
  export: `…basis_mode=consensus · reference_mode=whole-scan · displa…`. That
  caption *is* the provenance record and it is the part that travels into a
  paper, so cutting it mid-word defeats the reason it is burned in at all.
- **Colorbar and scale bar collide on tall, narrow maps.** Seen on a 200×50 scan
  with a display rotation applied: the `-0.04145 0 0.04145` colorbar and the
  `20 [pix]` scale bar stack into each other at the foot of the pane. Both are
  bottom-anchored with no awareness of one another.
- **"Recent-file access could not be remembered."** Logged after a successful
  open in the clean-account run: the app loaded the file but could not persist a
  security-scoped bookmark, so Open Recent will not reopen it. **Caveat before
  anyone chases this:** the test file was a *hard link* staged into
  `/Users/Shared`, which is unusual enough that it may be the cause. Re-test with
  a plain copy before treating it as an app defect.
- **The legacy `.icns` tops out at 256px.** After the move to an Icon Composer
  `.icon`, the compiled fallback carries only 16, 16@2x, 128 and 128@2x. macOS 26
  and later render from the `.icon` source and are correct at every size; on the
  macOS 14 floor this app declares, anything larger than 256px is upscaled — Get
  Info, Quick Look, large Finder icon view. The Dock is unaffected. Undecided
  whether to ship a legacy PNG set alongside.
- **#17a — aspect-aware pane arrangement.** Built, then reverted on sight
  2026-08-05. Needs a design decision, not an implementation.
- ~~**#36 — no progress indication while a datacube loads.**~~ **Fixed
  2026-08-06** by `load-pipeline-plan.md` stage L1, and **confirmed on the real
  app** on a 3.96 GB cube (patterns and MB both counting, bar advancing).
- **#37 — cancelling the virtual detector takes a long time.** *Re-measure
  after L2 (resident cube) — residency changes this problem entirely.*
- **#38 — the image panes' scroll monitor consumes every scroll in the window.**
- **#43 — the acceptance gate breaks if a session is saved for a training
  dataset.**
- **#31 — `validationIssues` is O(n²) and runs in a SwiftUI view body.**
- **#32 — `isSymmetry`'s bijection check has no fixture coverage**, and its
  stated counterexample does not exercise it.
- **#30 — origin calibration over a NAS runs at ~3 MB/s.** Investigation.
- **#11 — no WS₂ crystal model.** Scope question; `polycrystal_2D_WS2` cannot
  reach ACOM without one.
- **#18 — the campaign cannot reproduce the app's strain result on Si_SiGe.**
  Test-harness gap.
- **#15, #19, #20** — open measurement questions, low priority.

## Code hygiene

- **22 `.fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)` sites remain in `UI/`**,
  including 4 in `TaskPrerequisiteChecklist` — the construct that caused #16.
  Safe today and covered by `SplitViewHeightTests`, but unaudited.
- **A saved sidebar divider can restore below the declared minimum.** Observed
  144pt against `ContentView`'s declared `min: 250`. Every string wraps harder
  there than the layout was designed for. Test harnesses pin the width
  explicitly (`pinSidebarWidth`); the app does not.

## Working methods that earned their keep

Kept because they changed outcomes, not because they are tidy:

1. **Cost a UI change before designing it.** `SidebarDensityMeasurementTests`
   turned "it feels crowded" into 63pt of workspace rows and a 332pt shape
   change, and made the choice between options a measurement rather than taste.
2. **Adversarially review anything touching the science, and review the
   *diagnosis*, not just the code.** Twice now — 2026-08-05 and 2026-08-06 — a
   fix passed every test written for it, including one verified to fail without
   it, and was still wrong. Both times the refuting evidence was already in a
   log nobody had re-read.
3. **Never widen a gate that fails silently.** The QC harness's miss paths call
   `recordError` and continue; a control hidden behind a disclosure turns a
   failure into a finding nobody reads. Both are documented at the call sites.
4. **Open the app.** On the day of the tag, with all 30 harnesses green, ten
   minutes of driving the real app produced two defects the suite could not see:
   a colormap control missing from the only workspace that needed it, and a
   readiness row contradicting its own detail line. Neither is exotic; both are
   invisible to a test that never looks at the screen.
5. **A green suite can be green about the wrong thing.** On 2026-08-14 a change
   to how harnesses resolve their toolchain left 22 of them sourcing a helper by
   a `$0`-relative path *after* `cd`-ing to their own directory. They were
   broken. The suite stayed green at 28/28, because `tools/run-tests.sh` invokes
   each harness with an **absolute** path, so `$0` was absolute and the `cd` was
   harmless. The failure existed only for the direct invocation — the one
   `README.md` and `docs/technical-overview.md` tell a reader to use. It
   surfaced by accident, while running `package-test` by hand for an unrelated
   reason. Before trusting a suite, ask what calling convention it exercises,
   and whether that is the one anyone actually uses.
6. **A test written for your own fix proves nothing until it fails without it.**
   Standard practice here for science changes, and it paid off in the UI layer
   too: the first colormap test failed against the fix *and* against the old
   code, and only became useful once it was made to report what it could
   actually see. Which was nothing — SwiftUI builds a `Picker`'s menu lazily for
   a real assistive client, so in-process every pop-up is blank. The test now
   asserts the *decision* instead of the rendering, and says why at the call
   site so the dead end is not rediscovered.
